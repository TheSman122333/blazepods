blaze pods. 

i despise you.

I set out to make a product, open source it to compete with blaze pods, and here it is!

Basically you start the exe, wait 40-50 secs, draw rectangles or circles (c and r respectively), with a max of 4, and train. 

BlazeCam is basically meant for you to save 400$, on blazepods, by just allowing you to setup a laptop, and draw boxes or circles around physical objects, and step on them, to count hits. Our product also counts avg reaction time.
